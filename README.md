# Games with JavaScript

In this repository, I will upload javascript game projects that everyone can do to improve themselves. So you can pick one of them and start coding if you get stuck at some point you might look for solutions inside of my repository or you can e-mail me. Good luck :)


# 1-Simon Game
I saw this project(game) in Angela Yu's tutorial and wanted to make this site on my own. I used JavaScript(Jquery) HTML and CSS technologies while I was making the site.

# 2-RockPaperScissors Game
It is the one of the oldest game that everyone should know about it. Chine resources show that this game was playing at 15th century in China. I used JavaScript(Jquery) HTML and CSS technologies. <br> <br>

# 3-Clicking Game
A few years ago I was playing cs go a lot and I needed to develop my aim because am not good at fps games so I used different kinds of aim maps to develop my aim. I've made this game
for people like me. In-game you need to choose time and difficulty after that I need to click buttons that show up on the screen. good luck :) <br> <br> <br>
