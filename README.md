# Games with JavaScript

In this repository, I will upload javascript game projects that everyone can do to improve themselves. So you can pick one of them and start coding if you get stuck at some point you might look for solutions inside of my repository or you can e-mail me. Good luck :)


# 1-Simon Game
I saw this project(game) in Angela Yu's tutorial and wanted to make this site on my own. I used JavaScript(Jquery) HTML and CSS technologies while I was making the site.
